                graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code
                output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to
                implement algorithms.
                Programming languages are broadly categorized into three types Machine level language. Assembly level
                language. High-level language.
                Yes, there are over 300 programming languages, but you don't need to know them all, and you'll find that
                each language serves a specific purpose (or several). Compared to spoken languages, most are pretty easy to
                learn. Below are many of the top languages programmers are using

                are designed to run on desktop computers, and web applications which run in mobile web browsers rather than
                directly on the mobile device.A mobile app is a software application developed specifically for use on
                small,
                wireless computing devices, such as smartphones and tablets, rather than desktop or laptop computers.Mobile
                application development is the process to making software for smartphones and digital assistants, most
                commonly for Android and iOS. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app
                store or accessed through a mobile web browser.

            React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you
            compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.We’ll get to the funny
            XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data
            changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.

            Here, ShoppingList is a React component class, or React component type. A component takes in parameters,
            called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

            The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description
            and displays the result. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description
            of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures
            easier to write.

          <p>Aimed at designers and marketing people, Webflow is a no code web design tool invented for visual web
            design. It can be used for designing responsive websites, landing pages, eCommerce sites, blogs, and more.
            Beyond a web design tool, it also has CMS (content management system), and it's also a hosting platform.
            The Webflow Designer is a Photoshop-like interface that allows users to automatically generate semantic
            markup by dragging and dropping HTML elements onto a canvas and styling CSS properties.JavaScript is how it
            works. When you're using the Interactions panel in Webflow, you're adding JavaScript to your website. Since
            the potential of JavaScript is nearly unlimited, writing custom JavaScript can add a lot of new
            functionality to your website.
